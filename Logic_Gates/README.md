# Logic Gates

## Realization of Logic Equations using different modelling styles

1. 4-bit number divisible by 3 with NAND NAND Logic
2. 4-bit number divisible by 3 & 4 with NOR NOR Logic
3. Half Adder using 2 input NAND Gates
4. Full Ader using 2 input NAND Gates
5. (P + Q').(R' + D) using 2 input NAND Gates
6. Implement below logic equations using dataflow, structural and behavioural modelling
  * F = S(1, 2, 5, 7)
  * F1 = XZ + YZ' and F2 = XY' + YZ'
